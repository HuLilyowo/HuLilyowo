Hi there! ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jiayi (Lily) Hu, welcome to my Github!

Born and raised in Shanghai, I spent my 23-year stay in the beloved city. Currently, I'm in Los Angeles pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics degree at the University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business. As someone with only a degree in natural science, it was challenging to start a new journey in an unfamiliar area, but I truly appreciate my decision! I'm proud of the progress I've made during my time at USC, and I would love to share my work with you!
